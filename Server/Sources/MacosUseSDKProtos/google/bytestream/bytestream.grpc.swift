/// #### Introduction
///
/// The Byte Stream API enables a client to read and write a stream of bytes to
/// and from a resource. Resources have names, and these names are supplied in
/// the API calls below to identify the resource that is being read from or
/// written to.
///
/// All implementations of the Byte Stream API export the interface defined here:
///
/// * `Read()`: Reads the contents of a resource.
///
/// * `Write()`: Writes the contents of a resource. The client can call `Write()`
///   multiple times with the same resource and can check the status of the write
///   by calling `QueryWriteStatus()`.
///
/// #### Service parameters and metadata
///
/// The ByteStream API provides no direct way to access/modify any metadata
/// associated with the resource.
///
/// #### Errors
///
/// The errors returned by the service are in the Google canonical error space.
///
/// To build a server, implement a class that conforms to this protocol.

  /// `Write()` is used to send the contents of a resource as a sequence of

  /// broken during the `Write()`, the client should check the status of the

  /// `finish_write` set to `true` will cause an error. The client **should**
