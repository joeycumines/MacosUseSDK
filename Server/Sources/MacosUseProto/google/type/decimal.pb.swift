  /// The decimal value, as a string.
  ///
  /// The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`)
  /// or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits
  /// ("the integer"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed
  /// by an exponent.
  ///
  /// The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal
  /// digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer
  /// or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the
  /// fraction is referred to as the significand.
  ///
  /// The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`)
  /// followed by one or more decimal digits.
  ///
  /// Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by:
  ///
  ///   - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -> `2.5`).
  ///   - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -> `0.5`).
  ///   - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -> `2.5e8`).
  ///   - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -> `2.5`).
  ///
  /// Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs
  /// and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the
  /// decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` <-> `0.25`).
  /// Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction
  /// to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so.
  ///
  /// Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer
  /// and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale.
  /// Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a
  /// service does support them, values **must** be normalized.
  ///
  /// The ENBF grammar is:
  ///
  ///     DecimalString =
  ///       [Sign] Significand [Exponent];
  ///
  ///     Sign = '+' | '-';
  ///
  ///     Significand =
  ///       Digits ['.'] [Digits] | [Digits] '.' Digits;
  ///
  ///     Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits;
  ///
  ///     Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' };
  ///
  /// Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the
  /// maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable,
  /// the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it
  /// behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values.
  ///
  /// Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the
  /// value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and
  /// **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the
  /// service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC)
  /// if precision would be lost.
  ///
  /// Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in
