/// A quaternion is defined as the quotient of two directed lines in a
/// three-dimensional space or equivalently as the quotient of two Euclidean
/// vectors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).
///
/// Quaternions are often used in calculations involving three-dimensional
/// rotations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation),
/// as they provide greater mathematical robustness by avoiding the gimbal lock
/// problems that can be encountered when using Euler angles
/// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock).
///
/// Quaternions are generally represented in this form:
///
///     w + xi + yj + zk
///
/// where x, y, z, and w are real numbers, and i, j, and k are three imaginary
/// numbers.
///
/// Our naming choice `(x, y, z, w)` comes from the desire to avoid confusion for
/// those interested in the geometric properties of the quaternion in the 3D
/// Cartesian space. Other texts often use alternative names or subscripts, such
/// as `(a, b, c, d)`, `(1, i, j, k)`, or `(0, 1, 2, 3)`, which are perhaps
/// better suited for mathematical interpretations.
///
/// To avoid any confusion, as well as to maintain compatibility with a large
/// number of software libraries, the quaternions represented using the protocol
/// buffer below *must* follow the Hamilton convention, which defines `ij = k`
/// (i.e. a right-handed algebra), and therefore:
///
///     i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = −1
///     ij = −ji = k
///     jk = −kj = i
///     ki = −ik = j
///
/// Please DO NOT use this to represent quaternions that follow the JPL
/// convention, or any of the other quaternion flavors out there.
///
/// Definitions:
///
///   - Quaternion norm (or magnitude): `sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2)`.
///   - Unit (or normalized) quaternion: a quaternion whose norm is 1.
///   - Pure quaternion: a quaternion whose scalar component (`w`) is 0.
///   - Rotation quaternion: a unit quaternion used to represent rotation.
///   - Orientation quaternion: a unit quaternion used to represent orientation.
///
/// A quaternion can be normalized by dividing it by its norm. The resulting
/// quaternion maintains the same direction, but has a norm of 1, i.e. it moves
/// on the unit sphere. This is generally necessary for rotation and orientation
/// quaternions, to avoid rounding errors:
/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions
///
/// Note that `(x, y, z, w)` and `(-x, -y, -z, -w)` represent the same rotation,
/// but normalization would be even more useful, e.g. for comparison purposes, if
/// it would produce a unique representation. It is thus recommended that `w` be
/// kept positive, which can be achieved by changing all the signs when `w` is
/// negative.
